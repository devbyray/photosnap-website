# Photosnap Website Challenge

Our team challenged ourselves to build this beautifull design in the techniques you are comfortable with.

## What I used

- Vue.js
- Nuxt.js
- Tailwind CSS

It is hosted on Vercel: [CHECK RESULT](https://photosnap.byrayray.dev)

## What I changed?

- This design was created for light-mode, so I added a dark-mode view during the implementation.
- The design wasn't designed for checking on a 4K monitor, so I added my own creativity and implemented a better view on big monitors as well.
